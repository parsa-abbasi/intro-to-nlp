# An Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository contains the code for the Introduction to Natural Language Processing presentation given at the [Quera Data Science Bootcamp](https://quera.org/bootcamp/data-science) in November 2023.

## Slides
You can find the slides [here](https://parsa-abbasi.github.io/slides/nlp/).

## Notebooks
1. **Text processing:** `NLP_preprocessing.ipynb` contains the code for the text processing part of the presentation.
2. **Text representation:** `NLP_text_representation.ipynb` contains the code for the text representation part of the presentation.
3. **Naive Bayes:** A from scrach implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier can be found in `NLP_naive_bayes.ipynb`.
4. **Word Embeddings:** `NLP_word_embeddings.ipynb` contains an exploration of word embeddings.
5. **Song Recommender:** We built a song recommender system using the idea of word2vec. The code for this part can be found in `NLP_songs_recommandation.ipynb`.
